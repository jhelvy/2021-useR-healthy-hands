Hi everyone, my name is John Paul Helveston 

and I want to talk about solutions to keep our hands 

happy and healthy

## **Last year I typed 7.5 million key strokes**

I use R on a daily basis, and over the past year, I 

typed 7.5 million key strokes. 

In some months I logged over 1 million.

With that level of wear and tear, 

I started noticing a lot of wrist pain. 

So I began a quest to find solutions.

And this talk is just a summary of what I've found.

I've organized my thoughts into two categories:

To be more efficient in my typing, and  

to use more a more ergonomic keyboard

# Learn to touch type _well_

???

My first suggestion is really basic, and that's 

to learn to touch type well, and by that I don't just mean 

use all 10 fingers while typing.

I mean actually practice your typing.

I found that with just a little bit of consistent 

practice on key-br-dot-com, I increased my 

typing speed from about 60 to 90 words per minute 

in just one month. But I also found that my typing 

accuracy improved. As simple as it sounds, some regular 

typing practice can really go a long way.

# .center[Learn shortcuts]

.leftcol[
Insert a `<-` operator:

- **Windows**: `ALT` + `-`
- **Mac**: `OPTION` + `-`
]

.rightcol[
Insert a `%>%` operator:

- **Windows**: `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `M`
- **Mac**: `COMMAND` + `SHIFT` + `M`
]

???

My next suggestion is to master keyboard shortcuts.

RStudio is packed with super useful ones, like 

using "alt" + "dash" to create an assignment operator, 

or "Command" "shift" "M" to make a pipe.

But there are lots of lesser-known ones, 

like selecting some messy code and using 

control + I to auto-align everything.

Or to hold the Alt key then click and drag to 

generate multiple cursors. This is really helpful 

for doing things like editing elements in a vector.

I also highly recommend using a text expander, 

which are programs that convert short keywords 

into pre-formatted text snippets. 

In this example, you can see how I use the keywords 

on the left to quickly create some ggplot code for 

a scatterplot. I use an open source expander 

called espanso that is super easy to use 

to create your own custom expansions like I did here.

I custom expansions for all sorts of things.

For example, I use the keyword 'rrsetup' to generate

this whole code chunk, which I use at the start of most of my 

RMarkdown documents.

The particular expander I use is an open source one  

called espanso that is super easy to customize.

# Use keyboard layers

<br>

</center>
]

???

My third suggestion is to use keyboard layers.

Though you might not think of it this way, every 

keyboard has multiple layers. For example, 

when you hold the "shift" key, the lower-case 

letters become upper-case, and numbers become symbols. 

This is really useful because it allows us to keep 

our hands in one place while accessing other keys.

Unfortunately, many of the most useful keys for coding,

like our navigation arrows, require us to move our hands

away from the home row position. 

---

background-color: #fff
class: middle

<center>
<img src="images/keyboard_nav_layer.png" width=900>
</center>

???

A nice solution is to use layers to move these keys 

back under our home row position.

???

There are a number of programs for customizing and 

remapping your keyboard. On Windows most people use 

Auto-hot-key, and on Mac you can use Karabiner Elements.

# Caps Lock Layer

<center>
<img src="images/keyboard_remap.png" width=1100>
</center>

???

As an example, on my keyboard I've used 

Karabiner-Elements to re-map my caps lock key

such that when held down I get a new layer that 

has navigation arrows under my right hand, and 

cut, copy, and paste under my left

</video>
</center>

???

This enables me quickly navigate around in

RStudio and manipulate code without ever 

needing to leave the home row position.

So that was a lot of different software solutions

and hopefully some of those will work well for you

But there's also a lot to be gained by carefully 

considering the hardware you use.
