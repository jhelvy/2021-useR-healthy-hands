Hi everyone, my name is John Paul Helveston 

and I want to talk about solutions to keep our hands healthy

If you're like me and use R on a daily basis, 

chances are you are probably racking up some serious 

mileage on your keyboard. 

Over the past year, I myself typed 7.5 million key strokes, 

and in some months I log over 1 million.

---

With that level of wear and tear, 

I started noticing a lot of wrist pain. 

So I began a quest to find solutions.

My goal of this talk is just to share what I've found 

in the hopes that it might be helpful for others.

Before I go any further, I want to first say this talk is aimed 

at people who don't use platforms like Vim and Emacs.

These platforms are great, and if you use them, fantastic,

But not everyone does, so I'm going to highlight ideas that 

are hopefully useful for any general typist.

# Learn to touch type _well_

My first suggestion is really basic, and that's 

to learn to touch type well, and by that I don't just mean 

use all 10 fingers while typing.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Periodic programming advice: practice your touch typing skills. If you type less than 90 wpm and/or look at the keys, your typing speed is likely to be a programming bottleneck. Fortunately, it&#39;s one of the easiest bottlenecks to fix with a little deliberate practice.</p>&mdash; Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1169603647614967808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center>

???

I mean actually practice your typing skills. 

Hadley Wickham actually tweeted about this, 

saying you should aim for 90 words per minute. 

(he later wrote maybe 60 is more reasonable). 

I found that with just a little bit of consistent 

practice on key-br-dot-com, I increased my 

typing speed from about 60 to 90 words per minute 

in just one month. But it's not just about speed - 

it's about accuracy as well. The fewer times you have 

to press backspace the better.

???

The other thing I'll note on this is that I personally haven't 

seen much benefit to learning alternative keyboard layouts. 

While you can gain a little bit of typing speed by 

learning an alternative like DVORAK or COLEMAK, it's much, much 

more important that you really master ANY layout really well.

# .center[Learn shortcuts]

.rightcol[
Insert a `%>%` operator:

- **Windows**: `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `M`
- **Mac**: `COMMAND` + `SHIFT` + `M`

???

My next suggestion is to learn your shortcuts.

RStudio is packed with super useful ones, like 

using "alt" + "dash" to create an assignment operator, 

or "Command" "shift" "M" to make a pipe.

Or another one of my favorites is to hold Alt or Option 

and then click and drag to generate multiple cursors.

This is really helpful for doing things like editing 

elements in a vector.

# .center[Use a text expander]

</center>

???

But shortcuts are just a starting point for streamlining your typing.

There is a whole class of programs called text expanders

convert short text "triggers" into pre-formatted 

snippets. My favorite is espanso, which is an open source 

expander written in Rust, that is super easy to customize.  

---

# .center[Use a text expander]

.leftcol40[
`ggpoint`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot() +
    geom_point(aes(x = , y = ))
```

`ggsxc`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
scale_x_continuous() +
```

`ggsyc`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
scale_y_continuous() +
```
]

.rightcol60[
<br><center>
<img src="images/ggplot.gif" width=700>
</center>
]

???

In this example, you can see how I use the trigger "ggpoint" 

to quickly create ggplot code for a scatterplot, 

and I also use a couple other quick triggers to 

generate some code for the x and y axes.

---

# .center[Use a text expander]

.leftcol[
`rrsetup`

  fig.width = 7.252,
  fig.height = 4,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.retina = 3
)
```
````
]

???

One of my favorite custom expansions is the trigger

rrsetup, which generates this whole RMarkdown setup code 

chunk, which I use in most of my RMarkdown documents.

My third suggestion is to use additional keyboard layers.

Most keyboards have several layers. For example, 

when you hold down the "shift" key, you engage a new layer

where lower-case letters become upper-case,

and numbers become symbols. This is really useful because 

it allows us to keep our hands in one place while 

accessing other keys.

Unfortunately, many of the most useful keys for coding,

like our navigation arrows, require us to move our hands

away from the home row position. 

---

background-color: #fff
class: middle

<center>
<img src="images/navigation_layer.png" width=900>

???

A nice solution is to make these and other convenient 

keys available from a new layer so I don't have to 

keep moving my hands

???

There are a number of programs that support this. 

On Windows most people use Auto-hot-key, 

and on Mac there's a similar program called 

Karabiner Elements. These are both very flexible 

programs that allow you to customize and remap 

your entire keyboard.

---

background-color: #fff

# Caps Lock Layer

<center>
<img src="images/remap.png" width=1100>
</center>

???

As an example, on my keyboard I've used 

Karabiner-Elements to re-map my caps lock key

such that when held down I get a new layer that 

has navigation arrows under my right hand, and 

cut, copy, and paste under my left

---




???

This enables me quickly navigate around in

RStudio and manipulate code without ever 

needing to leave the home row position.

So that was a lot of different software solutions

and hopefully some of those will work well for you

But there's also a lot to be gained by carefully 

considering the hardware you use.

While I'm mostly going to talk about which keyboard you use,

I want to start by saying that

# Use a split keyboard

(inexpensive first)

class: center

# Use a split keyboard _that has thumb keys_

---

class: center

# Use a split keyboard _that is programmable_
